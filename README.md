# TutorialMod

A mod that adds Living Ingots, Summoning Wands, and Llamamen

While most of the code in this and other files were written by me

some code was written by KaupenJoe. Huge thanks to him and his tutorials

some help and ideas were provided by Emmymonchy on the PyreMarten discord server

Thanks to the MDD for providing java help in times of need

Thanks to Jacqueline Vile and their anonymous friend for the textures and animations of the Llama-Man
